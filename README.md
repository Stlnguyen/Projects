DASH - Infinite Runner Video Game

Authors - Stephen Nguyen and Steven Liu

Implemented using OpenGL libraries and C++. Heavy emphasis on keeping code neat using object-oriented methodology.

Created our own game engine first, with everything including gravity, animation, collision, etc. Then changed into an infinite runner. Challenges included solving fps drops by only rendering images on screen, getting animations to show behavior while in game.

Connect 4 AI - Artificial Intelligence that wins versus any average player.

Authors- Stephen Nguyen and Nathan Suh

Coded using Java. Requires Linux machine. Runnable with through terminal command "java Main -p1 minimax_stephenn_nathans". Compile using "javac minimax_stephenn_nathans.java" if needed.

Uses minimax algorithm combined with alpha-beta pruning to speed up decision tree searching, allowing for greater depths to be searched.

Note that the AI is not perfect. Perfect AI play would be a guaranteed win if the AI goes first.
